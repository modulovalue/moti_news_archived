# moti_news_archived

(late 2018)
Moti News was meant to be an RSS reader with a twist. I observed that there were more and more emojis.
I wanted to replace common keywords like Football, Bomb, Germany, German, ... with emojis. That way a user would be able to recognize what an article is about just by scrolling through the feed. _A picture says more than a thousand words._
